Description:<br />
Advanced Cargo Movement, Ltd. uses trucks of different types. <br />
Some trucks are used for vegetable delivery, other for furniture,<br />
or for bricks. The company has its own code describing each type <br />
of a truck. The code is simply a string of exactly seven lowercase<br />
letters (each letter on each position has a very special meaning<br />
but that is unimportant for this task). At the beginning of company's <br />
history, just a single truck type was used but later other types were <br />
derived from it, then from the new types another types were derived, <br />
and so on. <br />
<br />
Today, ACM is rich enough to pay historians to study its history. One <br />
thing historians tried to find out is so called derivation plan -- i.e. <br />
how the truck types were derived. They defined the distance of truck types<br />
as the number of positions with different letters in truck type codes. They <br />
also assumed that each truck type was derived from exactly one other truck<br />
type (except for the first truck type which was not derived from any other <br />
type). The quality of a derivation plan was then defined as <br />
<br />
<strong align="center">1/Σ(to,td)d(to,td)</strong><br />
<br />
where the sum goes over all pairs of types in the derivation plan such <br />
that to is the original type and td the type derived from it and d(to,td)<br />
is the distance of the types. Since historians failed, you are to write <br />
a program to help them. Given the codes of truck types, your program should<br />
find the highest possible quality of a derivation plan. <br />
<br />
Input:<br />
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case begins with a line <br />
containing the number of truck types, N, 2 <= N <= 2 000. Each of the following<br /> 
N lines of input contains one truck type code (a string of seven lowercase letters).<br />
You may assume that the codes uniquely describe the trucks, i.e., no two of these<br />
N lines are the same. The input is terminated with zero at the place of number of truck types.<br />
<br />
Output:<br />
For each test case, your program should output the text "The highest possible quality is 1/Q.",<br />
where 1/Q is the quality of the best derivation plan.<br />
<br />
Sample Input:<br />
4<br />
aaaaaaa<br />
baaaaaa<br />
abaaaaa<br />
aabaaaa<br />
0<br />
<br />
Sample Output:<br />
The highest possible quality is 1/3.<br />

#### 解题思路：  

<div style = "font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;color:black;">
边比较多所以要用short int来储存值，不然会爆内存，e数组大小
要给足，不然RE。输出最后有一个.不能忘了。用kruskal要稍微进行点优化，不然会超过1000ms。

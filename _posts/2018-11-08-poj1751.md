Description:<br />
The island nation of Flatopia is perfectly flat. Unfortunately, Flatopia <br />
has a very poor system of public highways. The Flatopian government is aware <br />
of this problem and has already constructed a number of highways connecting <br />
some of the most important towns. However, there are still some towns that<br />
you can't reach via a highway. It is necessary to build more highways so <br />
that it will be possible to drive between any pair of towns without leaving <br />
the highway system. <br />
<br />
Flatopian towns are numbered from 1 to N and town i has a position given by <br />
the Cartesian coordinates (xi, yi). Each highway connects exaclty two towns.<br />
All highways (both the original ones and the ones that are to be built) follow <br />
straight lines, and thus their length is equal to Cartesian distance between <br />
towns. All highways can be used in both directions. Highways can freely cross <br />
each other, but a driver can only switch between highways at a town that is<br />
located at the end of both highways. <br />
<br />
The Flatopian government wants to minimize the cost of building new highways. <br />
However, they want to guarantee that every town is highway-reachable from every <br />
other town. Since Flatopia is so flat, the cost of a highway is always proportional<br />
to its length. Thus, the least expensive highway system will be the one that minimizes <br />
he total highways length. <br />
<br />
Input:<br />
The input consists of two parts. The first part describes all towns in the country,<br />
and the second part describes all of the highways that have already been built. <br />
<br />
The first line of the input file contains a single integer N (1 <= N <= 750), <br />
representing the number of towns. The next N lines each contain two integers,<br />
xi and yi separated by a space. These values give the coordinates of ith town<br />
(for i from 1 to N). Coordinates will have an absolute value no greater than <br />
10000. Every town has a unique location. <br />
<br />
The next line contains a single integer M (0 <= M <= 1000), representing the number<br />
of existing highways. The next M lines each contain a pair of integers separated <br />
by a space. These two integers give a pair of town numbers which are already connected<br />
by a highway. Each pair of towns is connected by at most one highway. <br />
<br />
Output:<br />
Write to the output a single line for each new highway that should be built in order <br />
to connect all towns with minimal possible total length of new highways. Each highway <br />
should be presented by printing town numbers that this highway connects, separated by <br />
a space. <br />
<br />
If no new highways need to be built (all towns are already connected), then the output <br />
file should be created but it should be empty. <br />

#### 解题思路：  

<div style = "font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;color:black;">
绝对不能用结构体直接保存是否加入最小生成树，
否则会造成数组开大MTL，数组小RE，这个题目不需要输出答案，所以不需要sqrt求距离，还有如果输出的N-1个点后就跳出可以省时间

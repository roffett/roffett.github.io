Description:<br />
<br />
During the kindergarten days, flymouse was the monitor of his class. <br />
Occasionally the head-teacher brought the kids of flymouse’s class a <br />
large bag of candies and had flymouse distribute them. All the kids <br />
loved candies very much and often compared the numbers of candies they<br />
got with others. A kid A could had the idea that though it might be <br />
the case that another kid B was better than him in some aspect and <br />
therefore had a reason for deserving more candies than he did, he <br />
should never get a certain number of candies fewer than B did no <br />
matter how many candies he actually got, otherwise he would feel<br />
dissatisfied and go to the head-teacher to complain about flymouse’s<br />
biased distribution.<br />
<br />
snoopy shared class with flymouse at that time. flymouse always <br />
compared the number of his candies with that of snoopy’s. He wanted <br />
to make the difference between the numbers as large as possible while<br />
keeping every kid satisfied. Now he had just got another bag of <br />
candies from the head-teacher, what was the largest difference he could <br />
make out of it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Input<br />
The input contains a single test cases. The test cases starts with a line<br />
with two integers N and M not exceeding 30 000 and 150 000 respectively. <br />
N is the number of kids in the class and the kids were numbered 1 through<br />
N. snoopy and flymouse were always numbered 1 and N. Then follow M lines<br />
each holding three integers A, B and c in order, meaning that kid A <br />
believed that kid B should never get over c candies more than he did.<br />
<br />
<br />
Output<br />
Output one line with only the largest difference desired. The difference<br />
is guaranteed to be finite.<br />
<br />
Sample Input:<br />
2 2<br />
1 2 5<br />
2 1 4<br />
<br />
Sample Output:<br />
5<br />
<br />
Hint:<br />
32-bit signed integer type is capable of doing all arithmetic.<br />

#### 解题思路：  

<div style = "font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;color:black;">
卡vector又一题，dijkstra+优先队列+手写邻接表的差分约束模板题.<br />

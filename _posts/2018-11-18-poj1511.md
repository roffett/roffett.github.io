Description:<br />
In the age of television, not many people attend theater performances.<br />
Antique Comedians of Malidinesia are aware of this fact. They want to<br />
propagate theater and, most of all, Antique Comedies. They have printed<br />
invitation cards with all the necessary information and with the programme.<br />
A lot of students were hired to distribute these invitations among the <br />
people. Each student volunteer has assigned exactly one bus stop and<br />
he or she stays there the whole day and gives invitation to people <br />
travelling by bus. A special course was taken where students learned<br />
how to influence people and what is the difference between influencing <br />
and robbery. <br />
<br />
The transport system is very special: all lines are unidirectional and<br />
connect exactly two stops. Buses leave the originating stop with passangers<br />
each half an hour. After reaching the destination stop they return empty <br />
to the originating stop, where they wait until the next full half an hour, <br />
e.g. X:00 or X:30, where 'X' denotes the hour. The fee for transport between<br />
two stops is given by special tables and is payable on the spot. The lines<br />
are planned in such a way, that each round trip (i.e. a journey starting<br />
and finishing at the same stop) passes through a Central Checkpoint Stop<br />
(CCS) where each passenger has to pass a thorough check including body scan. <br />
<br />
All the ACM student members leave the CCS each morning. Each volunteer is<br />
to move to one predetermined stop to invite passengers. There are as many<br />
volunteers as stops. At the end of the day, all students travel back to<br />
CCS. You are to write a computer program that helps ACM to minimize the<br />
amount of money to pay every day for the transport of their employees. <br />
<br />
Input<br />
The input consists of N cases. The first line of the input contains only <br />
positive integer N. Then follow the cases. Each case begins with a line <br />
containing exactly two integers P and Q, 1 <= P,Q <= 1000000. P is the <br />
number of stops including CCS and Q the number of bus lines. Then there <br />
are Q lines, each describing one bus line. Each of the lines contains <br />
exactly three numbers - the originating stop, the destination stop and <br />
the price. The CCS is designated by number 1. Prices are positive integers<br />
the sum of which is smaller than 1000000000. You can also assume it is always <br />
possible to get from any stop to any other stop.<br />
<br />
Output<br />
For each case, print one line containing the minimum amount of money to be <br />
paid each day by ACM for the travel costs of its volunteers.<br />

#### 解题思路：  

<div style = "font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;color:black;">
题目求1到其他点 的最短距离，在求其他点到1点的最短距离，卡STL*/<br />
</div>
